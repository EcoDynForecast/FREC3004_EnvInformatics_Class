# Module 4: Water Quality

## Class time

3 - 1 hr 15 minute minute class periods

## Focal dataset

USGS Stream Nitrate

## Science question

How often do rivers in the U.S. exceed the EPA limit for water quality?

## Environmental Learning Objectives:

* Understand the variability of concentrations of dissolved substances in stream
  water and identify some reasons for this variability. 
* Find regulatory guidelines for nitrate concentrations in surface water, find 
  real-time nitrate concentration data, and recognize when observed 
  concentrations exceed guidelines
* Evaluate natural and anthropogenic factors that cause the concentrations of 
  nitrate to change over time
* Define the meaning of “statistical probability,” and use this term as a 
  regulatory tool to evaluate a potential drinking water resource

## Data Science Learning Objectives

* Practice importing data sets that aren't in a standard header format
* Apply if-statements and ifelse()()
* Apply loops for scaling-up analyses
* Pasting strings and numbers together
