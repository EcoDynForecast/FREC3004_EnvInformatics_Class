# PREREQUISTES:  

Sophomore standing required. Foundational knowledge in quantitative and computational thinking expected.


# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

*	Apply statistics and modeling to the analysis of environmental data collected at multiple spatial-temporal scales
*	Demonstrate how to acquire and store environmental data from data repositories
*	Create visualizations of environmental data, analyses, and uncertainty
*	Evaluate ethical and methodological issues associated with data curation, quality control, and sharing.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES ASSOCIATED WITH UNIVERSITY PATHWAYS

*	Explain the application of computational or quantitative thinking across multiple knowledge domains.
*	Apply the foundational principles of computational or quantitative thinking to frame a question and devise a solution in a particular field of study.
*	Construct a model based on computational methods to analyze complex or large-scale phenomenon.
*	Draw valid quantitative inferences about situations characterized by inherent uncertainty.
*	Identify ethical issues in a complex context.
*	Articulate and defend positions on ethical issues in a way that is both reasoned and informed by the complexities of those situations.

# ASSESSMENT

*	Module assignments (60%): Most of class time will be focused on analyzing different environmental dataset.  Each module will help develop different environmental informatics skills.  Each student will submit a written assignment associated with each module.  

*	Exams (40%):  The in-class exams assess the student’s capacity to apply previously learned techniques to a new environmental dataset.  There will be two exams through the semester.

# COURSE POLICIES:

*	The course uses the R programming language exclusively.  R is a common language in data science and ecology.  There will be instruction in R throughout the course but this is not a programming course.  R is a free language.  This allows you to use it in your future career without need to purchase a license. 

*	You are expected to bring your laptop computer to each class because you will be using in most classes.  Your laptop must have R and RStudio installed and working. 

*	Group vs. individual work.  Each assignment will specify whether it is group or individual work.  

*	The Undergraduate Honor Code pledge that each member of the university community agrees to abide by states:

 “As a Hokie, I will conduct myself with honor and integrity at all times. I will  not lie, cheat, or steal, nor will I accept the actions of those who do.”

Students enrolled in this course are responsible for abiding by the Honor Code. A student who has doubts about how the Honor Code applies to any assignment is responsible for obtaining specific guidance from the course instructor before submitting the assignment for evaluation. Ignorance of the rules does not exclude any member of the University community from the requirements and expectations of the Honor Code.

*	Your attendance at lecture is expected, and you are expected to be at class on time. Each class may include an in-class activity that requires your attendance to receive credit.

*	If you have a question, please do not hesitate to ask. In fact, other students probably have the same question! Come to lecture on time since we will start right away. In particular, the first five minutes of each lecture are quite crucial because they establish the direction for that session. Therefore, if you come in late, certain things may not make sense, and you will miss important announcements. Throughout the semester, please be courteous to all of your fellow students and to me so we can create a positive learning environment.

*	All assignments and lecture pdfs will be distributed using Canvas.

*	Any student with special needs or circumstances for exams or assignments should make arrangements to meet with the instructor during the first week of classes.

*	You are strongly encouraged to complete the Student Perceptions of Teaching (SPOT) questionnaire. Constructive student feedback is important for enhancing the learning experience in this course. Changes to the class and instruction may result from suggestions that are shared with me. Comments about specific aspects of the course or instruction are most helpful. For example, past comments indicated that real-world examples were important for helping students to understand key concepts, and so more of these examples were added to the course materials.
