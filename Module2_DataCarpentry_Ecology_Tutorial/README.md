# Module 2: Data Analysis and Visualization in R for Ecologist

This module follows the Data Analysis and Visualization in R for Ecologists lesson provided by the Data Carpentry project

<https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/>

## Class timing

Seven 1 hour 15 minute class periods

### Class Pacing

#### Class period 1 (1 hr - the first 15 minutes were reviewing Module 1)
* Covered "Before we start" to the second Challenge question of "Intro to R"
#### Class period 2 (1 hr 15 minutes)
* Second Challenge question of "Intro to R" to the start of the second Challenge question in "Starting with Data" 
#### Class period 3 (1 hr 15 minutes)
* Start of the second Challenge question in "Starting with Data" to the end of "Starting with Data" (minus the last Challenge question)
#### Class period 4 (1 hr 15 minutes)
* The last Challenge question in "Starting with Data" (skip the Formatting Dates because it was covered in Class 3) to the challenge question right before Reshaping
#### Class period 5 (1 hr 15 minutes)
* Reviewing the challenge question right before Reshaping through the challenge question for Reshaping.
#### Class period 6 (1 hr 15 minutes)
* Reviewing the challenge question for Reshaping, saving data, and through the end of the third challenge question of visualization (the one right before time series)
#### Class period 7 (1 hr 15 minutes)
* Visualization time series through the end of Visualization.

## Focal dataset

Rodent surveys with size measurments from the Portal project

Data is from the paper S. K. Morgan Ernest, Thomas J. Valone, and James H. Brown. 2009. Long-term monitoring and experimental manipulation of a Chihuahuan Desert ecosystem near Portal, Arizona, USA. Ecology 90:1708.

## Learning Objectives

I follow the Data Carpentary material except for teach the R and SQL sub-modules

I teach using live coding and give students time to work through the challenge questions in class

The students are required to do online quizes via our LMS (Canvas) between each class. They have two chances to take the quiz and I record the highest grade.  There are about 5 questions per quiz and the answers are automatically graded on Canvas.

Later modules in the class teach provide training in joins, for-loops, and if-else statements
