# Model 7: Terrestrial Carbon Stocks

## Class Time

### Option 1: Students only analyze live vegetation carbon stocks

Three 1 hour 15 minute class periods

### Option 2: Students only analyze live vegetation, dead vegetation and soil carbon stocks

4 - 1 hr 15 min class periods

## Focal dataset

National Ecological Observatory Network vegetation and soil carbon data products

## Science question

How much carbon is stored in a forest ecosystem and where in the ecosystem is 
it stored?

## Environmental Learning objectives

* Describe how vegetation carbon stocks vary between different ecosystem types 
* Calculate carbon in trees from individual tree measurements of size
* Scale carbon estimates from the individual tree to the plot (i.e., a set area)

## Data Science Learning objectives

* Developing a data science analysis plan
* Understands unfamiliar data tables and how they are linked.
* Applying prior data science skills to execute an analysis plan
* Generating an analysis that uses multiple tables of data
* Downloading and processing data from the National Ecological Observatory 
  Network
