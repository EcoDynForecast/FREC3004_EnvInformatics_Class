# Module 5: Terrestrial Carbon Flux

Three 75-minute class periods

## Focal data set

Eddy-covariance measurements from the FLUXNET database

*Note: As more flux data is avialable from the National Ecological Observatory Network the module can be modified to use it.  However, the NEON and other Ameriflux data is not as "clean" at FLUXNET2015 data products and will require modifications to the module to help the students work through less "clean" data.*

## Science question

How much carbon dioxide does a forest remove from the atmosphere?

## Environmental Learning objectives

Having completed the module students will be able to:

* Import and analyze net carbon fluxes from the FLUX2015 database using R, 
  tidyverse, and ggplot.
* Describe how carbon flux varies from minutes to annual time scales.
* Compare how the rate of carbon uptake by ecosystems varies among locations.
* Separate a net flux (NEP) into components (GPP and RE).
* Create informative figures in ggplot that display temporal variation in carbon
  fluxes.
