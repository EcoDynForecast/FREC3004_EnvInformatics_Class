# Module 1 Macrosystems EDDIE Cross Scale Interaction

The module directly uses the materials from the Macrosystems EDDIE project website.

I use 2 - 1 hr 15 minute class periods for the module.  I following the teaching materials except cutting out the presentations

I added an extra powerpoint that defines the difference between linear and non-linear interactions
