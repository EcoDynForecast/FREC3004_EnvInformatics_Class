# Module 5: Global Climate Change

## Class Time

Two 75-minute class periods

## Focal dataset(s)

NOAA Atmospheric CO2
NOAA Global Temperatue Anomalies
Ice core temperature proxy and CO2 data

## Science question

How do recent rates of global temperature and atmospheric CO2 change compare to 
pre-human rates of change?

## Environmental Learning Objectives:

* To analyze global temperature data to see if Earth’s average global 
  temperatures are increasing
* To analyze CO2 data to see if atmospheric levels are increasing
* To correlate CO2 data with global temperature to see if there is a 
  relationship
* To compare current trends with rates of change during pre-historic periods 
  using ice core data 
* To interpret what these results mean for understanding current climate change 

## Data Science Learning Objectives
